"""What the camera shows, as the page renders it.

Assertions use screenshots of the <video> element rather than frames drawn out
of the decoder, because a screenshot is what the user sees. The Pi burns a
clock into the picture, so "is this feed live?" is answered by OCRing that
clock twice and checking it advanced -- which a frozen picture cannot fake.

Because the camera runs on the Pi (fpgas-online-cam's cam.service), the feed
going away is itself evidence that the Pi lost power.
